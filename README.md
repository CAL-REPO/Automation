You can save key file in window like onedrive or sharepoint.
Set key and token file path to 'export GIT_KEY_SOURCE="PersonalKeyLocation"' in 'env.sh'.
Git token file should be txt file.
It is automated to github login with token via ssh.
It will help to install git and github.

I saved this file in my sharepoint and will help whenever i format wsl2 or windows.
